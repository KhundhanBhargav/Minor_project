🍎 Fruit Stage Monitoring Using Image Processing and CNN
This project utilizes image processing and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify fruits based on their freshness. It determines whether a fruit is fresh or rotten using deep learning techniques.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
OpenCV (for image preprocessing)
TensorFlow/Keras (for CNN model)
Flask (for deployment)
📌 Features
✅ Classifies fruits as fresh or rotten
✅ Uses image processing for feature extraction
✅ Deep learning model (CNN) for accurate classification
✅ Web-based interface for user interaction (via Flask)

🚀 How It Works
Users upload an image of a fruit.
The image undergoes preprocessing (resizing, normalization, etc.).
The trained CNN model predicts the freshness of the fruit.
The result is displayed on the Flask web interface.
📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of images of various fruits in fresh and rotten stages, collected from online sources or created manually.
